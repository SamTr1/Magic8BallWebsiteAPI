# Magic 8 Ball
This project implements an API that functions like a Magic 8 Ball, offering users four different types of 8 Balls to choose from. The program generates a web page using HTML and CSS, where each 8 Ball displays a random message when selected.

# Features
Four Unique 8 Balls: Users can select from four different 8 Balls, each with its own set of randomized messages.
Random Message Display: Each 8 Ball displays a randomly generated message, simulating the classic Magic 8 Ball experience.
Web Interface: A clean and interactive HTML/CSS page allows users to easily choose and interact with their preferred 8 Ball.
